    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      short version of my [CV](https://github.com/GunhoChoi) is here.


experiences:
    - role: AI Research Scientist
      time: July 2018 - Present
      company: Tomocube, Seoul Korea 
      details: |
        Tomocube is a holotomography company which uses laser technique to measure three-dimensional refractive index (RI) 
        tomogram of a microscopic sample such as biological cells and tissues. I apply deep learning techniques on RI tomogram
        such as bacteria cell classification, cell nucleus segmentation, unsupervised light coherence denoising, etc.
        
          - Classification of Bacteria Cells
          - Cell Nucleus Segmentation 
          - RI Tomogram Denoising

    - role: AI Research Scientist
      time: Nov 2017 - June 2018
      company: Interpark, Seoul Korea
      details: |
        At Interpark, I collaborated with Severance hospital to detect and classify lesions that cause Epilepsy. For detecting
        lesions, I applied Anomaly Detection algorithms on 3D brain MRI volume on multiple protocols. For classification of Epilepsy, 
        I took part in augmentation of EEG signals to handle data imbalance using InfoGAN.
        
          - Anomaly Detection on MRI
          - InfoGAN on EEG Singal


    - role: AI Research Intern
      time: June 2017 - July 2017
      company: DeepBio, Seoul Korea 
      details: |
        DeepBio is a company that applies DL on biological data. Classifying cancer state was one of the projects at the company
        and the classifier's performance was degraded depending on the staining style of histopathological image which was different
        hospital by hospital. In order to overcome this issue, I worked on stain style transfer using DL technique called GAN.
        
          - Stain Style Transfer of Histopathologic Images


    - role: AI Research Scientist
      time: Feb 2017 - June 2017
      company: Laftel, Seoul Korea 
      details: |
        Laftel is an animation streaming service in Korea. Simply, it is an animation version of Netflix.
        In Laftel, I worked on scene classification which was used for recommendation. Also, I worked on scene style 
        clustering using DL based style extraction algorithm inspired by "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"
        
          - Scene Classification
          - Animation Style Clustering

education:

    - degree: BS in Business Management
      university: Yonsei University
      time: 2010 - 2015
      details: |
        Yonsei university is the [2nd best](https://www.4icu.org/kr/) university in South Korea. I chose Business Management
        as my major with the expectation of being able to learn how to achieve something innovative through analysis of 
        current and expected future situation in a quantitative way. However, as I attended classes such as Marketing, HR(Human Resource
        management), MIS(Management Information Systems), I could not learn what I expected. I just havd to memorize some concepts,
        present some prediction by guessing without quantitative evidence.

          - Expectation: Quantitative Innovation
          - Reality: Prediction by guessing


    - degree: BS in Computer Science 
      university: Yonsei University
      time: 2014 - 2017
      details: |
        Because I could not learn what I expected in Business Management, I started my double major as Computer Science after
        finishing my military obligation as [KATUSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Augmentation_To_the_United_States_Army)(2011-2012).
        I chose CS because being able to use computer will help me gather, analyze and visualize data so that I can understand,
        prove, and share. In 2016, AlphaGo came out and I was attending my AI class at that period. I got interested in Machine
        Learning techniques, especially Deep Learning which played a role as a game changer. However, because my AI class did not
        provide any DL algorithms, I started to search those in the Internet.
        
          - Gather, Analyze, Visualize data -> Understand, Prove, Share 
          - Motivation for Deep Learning
