education:

    - degree: BS in Business Management
      university: Yonsei University
      time: 2010 - 2015
      details: |
        Yonsei university is the [2nd best](https://www.4icu.org/kr/) university in South Korea. I chose Business Management
        as my major with the expectation of being able to learn how to achieve something innovative through analysis of 
        current and expected future in a quantitative way. However, as I attended classes such as marketing, HR(Human Resource
        management), MIS(Management Information Systems), I could not learn what I expected. I just memorized some concepts,
        presented some prediction by guessing without quantitative evidence.

          - Expectation: Quantitative Innovation
          - Reality: Prediction by guessing


    - degree: BS in Computer Science 
      university: Yonsei University
      time: 2014 - 2017
      details: |
        Because I could not learn what I expected in Business Management, I started my double major as Computer Science after
        finishing my military obligation as [KATUSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Augmentation_To_the_United_States_Army)(2011-2012).
        I chose CS because being able to use computer will help me gather, analyze and visualize data so that I can understand,
        prove, and share. In 2016, AlphaGo came out and I was attending my AI class at that period. I got interested in Machine
        Learning techniques, especially Deep Learning which played a role as a game changer. However, because my AI class did not
        provide any DL algorithms, I started to search those in the Internet.
        
          - Gather, Analyze, Visualize data -> Understand, Prove, Share 
          - Motivation for Deep Learning
